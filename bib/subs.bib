  title =         {End the Senseless Killing: Improving Memory Management for Mobile Operating Systems},
    url={papers/marvin-asplos.pdf},
  abstract =      {To ensure low-latency memory allocation, mobile
                  operating systems needing memory kill applications
                  instead of swapping memory to disk.  This design
                  choice shifts the burden of managing over-utilized
                  memory to application programmers, requiring them to
                  constantly checkpoint their application state to
                  disk. This paper presents Marvin, a new memory
                  manager for mobile platforms that efficiently
                  supports swapping while meeting the strict
                  performance requirements of mobile apps.  Marvin's
                  swap-enabled language runtime is co-designed with
                  OS-level memory management to avoid common pitfalls
                  of traditional swap mechanisms. Its three key
                  features include: (1) a new swap mechanism, called
                  ahead-of-time (AOT) swap, which pre-writes
                  memory to disk, then harvests it quickly when
                  needed, (2) a modified bookmarking garbage collector
                  that avoids swapping in unused memory, and (3) an
                  object-granularity working set estimator. Our
                  experiments show that Marvin can run more than 2x as
                  many concurrent apps as Android, and that Marvin can
                  reclaim memory over 60x faster than Android with a
                  Linux swap file can allocate memory under memory
                  pressure.  }}
