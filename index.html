<h3> My research focuses on datacenter operating systems and distributed
      systems.</h3>
  <p>
    I am especially interested in making it easier to build
    microsecond-scale datacenter systems by leveraging new datacenter
    hardware technologies, like kernel-bypass, RDMA and programmable
    devices.  My most recent work has been on
    the <a href="//github.com/microsoft/demikernel">Demikernel
    datapath OS</a> and related projects.    A <a href="bio.txt">bio</a> and
      <a href="abstract.txt">talk abstract</a> for my most recent work
      is available.

    I completed my PhD in 2017 at
    the <a href="//www.cs.washington.edu">University of
    Washington</a>, where my research focused on distributed systems that
    span mobile devices and cloud servers.  My thesis work received
    the ACM SIGOPS Dennis Ritchie doctoral dissertation award and the UW
    Allen School William Chan doctoral dissertion award.  Before my
    PhD, I received my S.B. and M.Eng.
    from <a href="http://www.mit.edu">MIT</a> and worked for 3 years
    in the virtual machine monitor group
    at <a href="https://www.vmware.com">VMware</a>.

    I was born in <a href="http://www.ebeijing.gov.cn/">Beijing,
      China</a> but spent most of my time growing up
      in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Indiana">Columbus,
      Indiana</a>. <a href="http://www.drkp.net">My husband</a> and I
      like to cook, travel and occasionally do computer science
      together.
