The Demikernel/Catnip networking stack is now available on
[Github](https://github.com/iyzhang/demikernel/tree/master/src/rust/catnip).
Catnip is a TCP/IP stack for DPDK written from scratch in Rust.  We
will be presenting its design and implementation at [DPDK Summit North
America](https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/dpdknorthamerica2019/).
