After much clean-up, the TAPIR codebase is available! In addition to
TAPIR, this codebase includes lots of bonuses, including:
1. An implementation of a high-performance lock server designed to run on IR.
2. An implementation of Viewstamped Replication.
3. An implementation of a conventional partitioned transactional storage system that supports both optimistic concurrency control and
strict two-phase locking.

You can find the code here: https://gitlab.cs.washington.edu/syslab/tapir
