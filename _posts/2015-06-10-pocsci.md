I recently co-chaired the Symposium on Potentially Computer Science
(PoCSci '15). As many people know, PoCSci is the premier venue for
fake computer science research, and there was a lot of exciting work
presented this year, especially from our
[keynote speaker](http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~strib/). More on the
event at the
[CSE News](https://news.cs.washington.edu/2015/06/05/15th-annual-uw-cse-symposium-on-potentially-computer-science-pocsci-15/).
