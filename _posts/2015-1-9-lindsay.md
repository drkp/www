**Lindsay's Retirement Party**

On Friday, the department held a party celebrating graduate counselor,
Lindsay Michimoto. Lindsay has been with the department for 15 years,
and in that time has processed 14,245 applications to the
Ph.D. program (including mine twice!) and advised 602
Ph.D. students. She is definitely one of the very unique features of
CSE and is probably responsible for me going to grad school at all.

A few PhD students (not me!)  sang a musical number dedicated to
Lindsay's many years of listening to complaining grad students. More
