MSR has just named me a 2015 [Research
Ph.D. Fellow](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/collaboration/global/northam/northam-fellows.aspx). Thanks
to Microsoft for their support of Ph.D. students! As usual, Ed has
more to say on the [CSE
news](https://news.cs.washington.edu/2015/01/22/lilian-de-greef-and-irene-zhang-win-microsoft-research-ph-d-fellowships/).
