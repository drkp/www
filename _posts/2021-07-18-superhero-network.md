title: The Superhero Network - A Case for Expertise in CS Sexism and Harassment
---

I spent the bulk of last week doing two types of service that I don't
necessarily enjoy but feel is important: reviewing SOSP papers and
dealing with harassment.  As an increasingly senior woman in the
systems community, I get called on regularly to do both.  When I
review for SOSP, I lend my expertise to the community by critiquing
papers aiming to solve a variety of problems in systems.  I'm an
expert because I have tried to solve these problems myself, so I
understand them and the solution space.  This is the big benefit of
submitting to SOSP: you get a panel of experts that work on the same
problems to look at your research and let you know what is working and
what isn't, which hopefully you can then implement to improve your
research.  I end up offering the same advice so much that I recently
wrote [a blog post on it.](_posts/2021-6-5-hints.md)

In contrast to SOSP reviewing, I made this HotCRP reviewer expertise
metric for D&I/coping with harassment:

1. No Familiarly: Not aware that the problem exists. Most people fall
   into this category, including myself, barring the few times that I
   experienced harassment myself.
   
2. Some familiarity: Aware of the problem but do not necessarily think
   it's solvable or worth solving. Alternatively, may be aware of the
   problem and why it's important but do not having any ideas on how to
   solve it.

3. Knowledgeable: Has some expertise on the problem and is able to
   propose solutions.

4. Expert: Has a deep understanding of the problem from working on
   it. Has implemented some previous solutions and  understands what
   works and doesn't.
   
I would rank myself between a 1 and 2 on this scale and if I were to
assemble an "SOSP PC" for D&I, I would absolutely not include myself!
Worse, when I work on D&I efforts, I am a 1.5 trying to convince a
bunch of other people that are a between 0-1 on this scale!!

Recently, I have tried to increase my expertise by educating myself
about harassment in the academic community.  Unfortunately, there is
limited related work and I would call most of the papers "measurement
papers" that analyze the problem but do not propose solutions.  Worse,
there's almost no research on solutions (for CS) that have been
tested, evaluated and work.  I also cannot find any experts to advise
me (or they are all too busy).  Maybe real experts do not even exist
because no one has made it their work to fight, and especially
prevent, harassment in the CS community.  As a community, we are
reactionary: we get together and talk about it when specific incidents
happen but have not implemented prevention.

Let me very clear: Harassment of all forms (sexual, sexism, racism,
bullying) exists in the CS community.  It is pervasive and
"cancelling" a few problematic members of the community will not fix
it.  We must focus on prevention, instead of intervention, because
once someone has had a bad experience, it is already too late.  While
the ACM CARES committees and conference diversity chairs are a step in
the right direction, none of the people in these roles are experts
either.  I was asked to be on the SIGOPS CARES committee and I
certainly am not.

The [Superhero network](https://github.com/iyzhang/superhero-network)
aims to fix that.  I want to gather and train a group of people to be
experts in coping with and fighting harassment.  We will do research,
read the literature, share experiences and mentor each other.  We will
put together references and recommendations for conferences and help
others that are looking to help. And hopefully, together we will move
the needle on this problem that desperately needs attention.
