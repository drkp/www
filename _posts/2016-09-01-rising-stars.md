I'm excited to be attending the
[Rising Stars workshop](https://risingstars.ece.cmu.edu/) at CMU in
October. From the webpage, Rising Stars "brings together the worldâ€™s
brightest women Ph.D. students, postdocs, and engineers/scientists,
for two days of scientific interactions and career-oriented
discussions aimed at navigating the early stages of careers in
academia."
