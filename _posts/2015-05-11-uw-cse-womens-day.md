I recently organized a mini-conference at CSE in the spirit of the
annual Grace Hopper Conference as a celebration of women in the
department. Eight women faculty, researchers and PhD students from the
department, Microsoft Research and the Allen Institute for Artificial
Intelligence gave talks on their research to a group of
undergraduates, high school students and PhD students. We also had a
lunch discussion, a faculty panel and more than 15 posters from women
around the department. Overall, a great day to see exciting research
done by women!

Ed has some of the background on how the event came to be on the
