In the end-of-year rush, I completely missed that the
[ACM Queue](http://queue.acm.org/) published my invited article on
distributed transactions for their "Research for Practice"
series. [My article](http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3023318)
summarizes three recent papers -- Spanner, TAPIR, and Callas -- and
discusses why they are important innovations for distributed
transactions.
