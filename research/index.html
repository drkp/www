<h2>Current Research</h2>
<p>
My PhD research broadly covers operating systems and distributed
systems for large-scale, distributed applications. I am working on
better transactional storage, flexible mobile/cloud deployment and
practical user-level I/O for these types of applications. My currently
ongoing projects are:
</p>
<!-- <h3>Optimistic Replicated Two-Phase Commit</h3> -->
<p>
<b>Optimistic Replicated Two-Phase Commit</b>, or OR-2PC, is a new
protocol integrating two-phase commit, replication and concurrency
control. By taking advantage of <em>cross-protocol</em> optimizations,
OR-2PC is able to commit transactions in a single round-trip with the
same consistency guarantees and transaction model as conventional
protocols.<br />

<!-- <h3>Sapphire</h3> -->
<p>
<b>Sapphire</b> is a new distributed programming platform that provides
<em>customizable</em> and <em>extensible</em> deployment of
mobile/cloud applications.  This flexibility enables programmers to
separate deployment logic from their application, while maintaining
fine-grained control over performance trade-offs.<br />

<!-- <h3>Arrakis</h3>  -->
<p>
<b>Arrakis</b> is a new operating system that takes advantage of
hardware virtualization technology to eliminate the operating system
from fast-path I/O operations. Arrakis allows applications to directly
access the hardware during normal execution, providing significantly
better performance, reliability and customizability.<br />

<h2>Research at VMware</h2>
<p>
Before starting my PhD, I worked on several research projects at
VMware. My primary focus was on improving the performance of restoring
checkpointed virtual machines. My work included:
</p>
<p><b>Halite</b> is a new VM checkpointing system for VMware ESXi Server that
optimizes for checkpoint restore performance. Halite improves disk
efficiency and overall performance during restore by organizing
checkpointed memory based on access locality.

</p>
<p><b>Working set restore</b> is a new technique for restoring checkpointed
virtual machines that predicts the working set of VM memory pages
before checkpointing and prefetches those pages on restore, reducing
overhead on the VM. This project included a new metric for measuring
VM performance on restore, as well as an implementation of working set
restore for VMware Workstation.
</p>

<h2>Research at MIT</h2>
<p>
I worked on a number of research projects with great people while at
MIT as an undergrad and MEng. Some notable projects that I worked on:
</p>
<p><b>TxCache</b> is a distributed, in-memory, application-level cache
with transactional consistency and automated cache invalidations. By
using recent snapshots for read-only transactions to optimize cache
utilization and eliminate cache invalidation, TxCache provides the
same performance benefits as other in-memory caches without violating
transactional consistency. I worked on this project
with <a href="http://drkp.net">Dan
Ports</a>, <a href="http://web.mit.edu/amdragon/www/pubs/">Austin
Clements</a>, <a href="http://www.pmg.csail.mit.edu/~liskov/">Barbara
Liskov</a> and <a href="http://db.lcs.mit.edu/madden/">Sam Madden</a>.
</p>
<p><b>WheelFS</b> is a flexible, wide-area file system that gives
applications control over performance trade-offs, but with a standard
POSIX interface. My master's thesis work focused on using prefetching
and cooperative caching for efficient file distribution in WheelFS. I
was advised by <a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~strib/">Jeremy
Stribling</a>, <a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/rtm/">Robert
Morris</a> and <a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~kaashoek/">Frans
Kaashoek</a>.
</p>
<p><b>FreshBreeze</b> is a new multiprocessor architecture designed to
support the design of functional programs by providing a single global
address space, a no-update, cycle-free heap and fine-grained
threading. As an undergraduate, I worked
with <a href="http://csg.csail.mit.edu/Users/dennis/">Prof. Jack
Dennis</a> to develop a cycle-accurate simulation of the processor
architecture.
